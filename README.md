# Simple - CPP - Compile - Generator
## About
This simple program will generate compile command for C++ programs by traversing the includes in files by using BFS.<br>
There are some assumptions here:
1. The .cpp will be in the same directory with .hpp
2. All includes are done in .hpp
3. There will be no circular dependencies
